                                Before you, I didn't know what love was. You know when someone in a kids' show is like, "How do I know I'm in love?" and someone usually responds, "You just know."? Yeah, I thought that was complete bull. There was no way you could just know. 
                            </p>

								Being gay was hard for me not only because of the controversy surrounding it, but also the fear of disappointing my parents. It took a huge toll on my self-esteem and I began to hate myself more and more everyday. I've never really been the overtly flambouyant gay kid, but I still hated myself for even looking at men the way I should be looking at women. Because of this, I tried to change anything that was even remotely gay. One of the things I hated the most, and still dislike today, is my voice. I think that it's the most obvious reason I'm gay, y'know... besides taking it in my poop chute.
							</p>
							<p>
								I was a bit more reserved. I didn't laugh too much. I found things funny and I joked around a bit, but I never laughed more than a few times a day. My main source of entertainment was usually Netflix, which was filled with random shows as background noise. I also never got too uncomfortable, especially with making new friends. Making and maintaining friendships is still a very hard thing for me.

                                <b>I know how love feels.</b> I told you about the scenes in Jane the Virgin when they talk about someone they love and their hearts glow. I think this is the best way to describe love. I debated whether I should tell you I loved you because we'd only known each other for about two months, which is actually the average time people say it. In Abilene, though, was when I just couldn't wait. I didn't mean for it to be that way, but it physically hurt me not to say it. Now, every time I talk to you, every time I'm about to see you, my heart races. It still does. My average heart rate when I'm about to hang out with you is 113 and it's never caused by nervousness now, it's caused by excitement.
                            </p>
							<p>
								<b>I'm proud of myself now.</b> I never ever planned to come out to my parents or my family. I've been known as a clandestine person and I dealt with all my problems alone. When you came along, a lot of this changed. Within the first few months of knowing you, I'd never wanted to tell someone about a person so much. I told my entire family I was gay, and now I'm content with myself. I'm not afraid to hold your hand in public anymore and I openly talk about my amazing relationship with you to everyone. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>I laugh a lot more.</b> Everything seems funnier, almost like a high, but legal. Shows are funnier and movies are hillarious. Although I laugh quite a bit alone, the amount of laughter I have with you is amazing. I never thought I could laugh so much to the point where my face actually hurt. I'm more social. I don't think you necessarily pushed me too hard in this aspect, but I'm so much happier now that I don't mind starting conversations
