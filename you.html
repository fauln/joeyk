								<p>I know we've agreed to not use this term, but it's truly how I see you. When I look at you, I see everything you see except I love all of it. From your looks to your personality, you have it all. In all honestly, there are numerous reasons to love you, even the traits that you don't like about yourself. You're an incredible person and I'm truly the luckiest person around. </p>

								<a href="">Your Personality</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
							I compliment your looks pretty frequently because I simply find you extremely attractice. What I don't mention too much is your personality, which is a huge mistake. Joey, if I was blind, I'd still fall in love with you, because your personality is amazing. From your ramblings and extensive knowledge of movies, to your deep love of music, to your hillarious, top-notch humor and meme game, I'm always astounded by how we can talk just about everything.

								<a href="">Your Laugh</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
							You've told me how someone in the past once said you had a terrible laugh. I completely disagree, obviously. Your regular laughs are superb, but when you <i>truly</i> laugh, I can't help but want to smile. There are key moments that I remember very well. <b>1.</b> The time you beat me in Smash Bros after I had the obvious dub, I died inside, but your laugh made my humiliating defeat a little more bearable. <b>2.</b> The time we met in Abilene and I had a few jokes to tell, we were both dying that day. <b>3.</b> When we watched Borat and "ugly-laughed" at every single thing.

								<a href="">Your Caring Nature</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
							I'm not sure how you are with others, but you always care about me. You make sure I'm okay, and that's something that's foreign to me in a way. Thank you for checking up on me when I've had a bad week and always making me happy. 
							</dd>
							<dt>
								<a href="">Your Looks</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
							Not to sound shallow in the slightest, but you're extremely attractive to me. Everything about you blows me away and every time I see you, I'm still in awe. <b>Your eyes</b> are green, but not always and not completely. During Lubbock Pt. 2, there was a time when we were in our AirBnb in a state of unease, planning what to do to get you home in time. We sat at the small little table and you were looking outside, probably internally freaking out. Don't worry, I was too. But in that moment, the sun was hitting your eyes and I notice there was tiny bit of blue mixed in with the green. I wanted to say something, but we had to focus on the task at hand. <b>Everything</b> about your body amazes me, even the parts you don't like. No matter what state you're in, sober, intoxicated, sleepy, etc. I will always find you attractive.

                            <dt>
								<a href="">Your Presence</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
							I'm easily irritated. Maybe you know this, maybe not. But whenever I'm in a bad mood or have been out too long, I get annoyed pretty easily. I'll never say anything, though and I'll try to mask it to be polite. Even with some close friends, I can't stay out too long; my social battery just gives out. With you, though, I'm never tired. I could spend an entire weekend plus more and still never be tired of you. Whether it's us sharing our nerdy hobbies like Star Wars and Pokemon or getting drunk at a party and constantly telling each other and everyone else around us how much we love the other. When we first met, I didn't expect to stay long. But the moment we made our big hand, big glove joke along with other stuff, I didn't want to leave. 
							</dd>
                            <dt>
								<a href="">Your Passion</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
							Whenever you nerd out about an anime, debate, music, or a movie, I can't help but smile. You're pretty cute when you do it and you have this nice smile on your face whenever you do talk about it... unless it's GOT S8 or Star Wars Episode I of course. I also appreciate how you allow me to enlighten you with my nerdy stuff.
